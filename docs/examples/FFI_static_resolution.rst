Example 4b: Static finite-fault estimation, resolution based patch discretization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we will determine a variable slip distribution for the L'aquila 2009 earthquake by using static InSAR data.
In contrast to `Example 4a <https://pyrocko.org/beat/docs/current/examples/FFI_static.html#>` we will use resolution based
discretization of fault patches following the approach of [Atzori&Antonioli2011]_. It is assumed that the reader has Example 4a completed before following this example, in order to be familiar with the concepts and commands for uniform discretized faults.

Clone
^^^^^
Please clone the config_ffi.yaml from the previous uniform static FFI run for the Laquila earthquake::

  beat clone Laquila Laquila_resolution --mode=ffi --datatypes=geodetic --copy_data

Calculate Greens Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the uniformly discretized fault variable slip estimation we did define the reference fault geometry based on the results of `Example 3 <https://pyrocko.org/beat/docs/current/examples/Rectangular.html#>` where we did estimate the fault geometry parameters. Based on the reference fault and the available data observations the model resolution matrix can be calculated and the fault can be divided into patches such that a defined threshold of resolution is met. For details on the algorithm I refer the reader to the original article of [AtzoriAntonioli2011]_.

In this example we want to discretize the fault surface using such a resolution based discretization. Todo so, please set the *discretization* attribute of the *gf_config* to *resolution* and run the update command to display changes to the config::

  beat update Laquila_resolution --mode=ffi --diff

Rerun without --diff to apply the changes::

  beat update Laquila_resolution --mode=ffi

The discretization config should look now like this::

    discretization: resolution
    discretization_config: !beat.ResolutionDiscretizationConfig
      extension_widths:
      - 0.1
      extension_lengths:
      - 0.1
      epsilon: 0.005
      resolution_thresh: 0.95
      depth_penalty: 3.5
      alpha: 0.3
      patch_widths_min:
      - 1.0
      patch_widths_max:
      - 5.0
      patch_lengths_min:
      - 1.0
      patch_lengths_max:
      - 5.0

The patch sizes will be iteratively optimized to be between the min and max values in length and width. Starting from large patches at *patch_widths_max* and *patch_lengths_max* they will be divided into smaller pieces until the patches are either smaller/equal than the defined *patch_widths_min* and *patch_lengths_min* or if the patches resolution is below the defined *resolution_thresh*. The *alpha* parameter determines how many of the patch candidates to be divided further are actually divided further in the next iteration (0.3 means 30%). The *epsilon* parameter here is most important in determining the final number of patches. The higher it is the smaller the number of patches is going to be. The *depth_penalty* parameter is set to a reasonable value and likely does not need to be touched. The higher it is the larger the patches that are at larger depth
are going to be.  

For the Laquila case please set the following config attributes to:

================= ======
  Attribute name   Value
================= ======
          epsilon   0.15
            alpha    0.1
 patch_widths_min    2.0
 patch_widths_ma    30.0
patch_lengths_min    2.0
patch_lengths_max   40.0
    depth_penalty    5.0
================= ======

The *nworkers* attribute determines the number of processes to be run in parallel to calculate the Greens Functions and should be set to a sufficiently high number that the hardware supports (number of CPU -1). Then start the discretization optimization with::

  beat build_gfs Laquila_resolution --mode=ffi --datetypes=geodetic --execute --force --plot

.. note:: The --force option is needed to overwrite the previously discretized fault object that was copied during the clone command above.

From the log on the screen we can see the following lines the discretization ended up with::

ffi.fault    - INFO     Next generation npatches 86
ffi.fault    - INFO     Found 0 candidate(s) for division for  1 subfault(s)
ffi.fault    - INFO     Finished resolution based fault discretization.
ffi.fault    - INFO     Quality index for this discretization: 0.930896
beat         - INFO     Plotting patch resolution to /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/LaquilaJointPonlyUPDATE_wide_resolution/ffi/figures/patch_resolutions_eps_0.15.pdf
beat         - INFO     Storing optimized discretized fault geometry to: /home/vasyurhm/BEATS/LaquilaJointPonlyUPDATE_wide_resolution/ffi/linear_gfs/fault_geometry.pkl
beat         - INFO     Fault discretization optimization done! Updating problem_config...

The quality index (QI) may be at maximum 1.0 and the higher it is the better the final overall resolution of the data to determine the slip on each fault patch. 0.875069 in this case is reasonably high, but it might be good to further increase the *epsilon* value to arrive at an even higher QI. Of course, this trades of with the details of features that may be resolved in
the final slip distribution. The --plot option creates a plot of the discretized fault geometry with the individual patch resolutions. The higher the resolution the better the slip can be resolved.

As we do have irregular patch sizes we cannot use the *nearest_neighbor* *correlation_function* for the Laplacian, but we use a *gaussian* instead. Please edit the file accordingly! The *mode_config* should look like this::

  mode_config: !beat.FFIConfig
    regularization: laplacian
    regularization_config: !beat.LaplacianRegularizationConfig
      correlation_function: gaussian
    initialization: lsq
    npatches: 119
    subfault_npatches:
    - 119

..warning:: The *npatches* and *subfault_npatches* argument was updated automatically and must not be edited by the user. These might differ slightly for the run of each user depending on the parameter configuration and as the discretization algorithm is not purely deterministic.

Now the following command allows to plot the resulting patch discretization.::

  beat check Laquila_resolution --mode=ffi --what=discretization

..image:: ../_static/example4/Laquila_FaultGeometry_resolution_discretization.png
   :height: 350px
   :width: 350 px

Sample
^^^^^^
Now the solution space can be sampled using the same sampler configuration as for example 4a, but with the resolution based fault discretization::

  beat sample Laquila_resolution --mode=ffi


..warning:: Please be aware that if the full kinematic model setup is planned to be run after the variable static slip estimation, the resolution based discretization cannot be used in its implemented form as the algorithm only works for static surface data. 


Summarize and plotting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the sampling successfully finished, the final stage results have to be summarized with::

 beat summarize Laquila_resolution --stage_number=-1 --mode=ffi

After that several figures illustrating the results can be created.

For the slip-distribution please run::

  beat plot Laquila_resolution slip_distribution --mode=ffi

.. image:: ../_static/example4/Laquila_static_slip_dist_-1_max.png

To get histograms for the laplacian smoothing, the noise scalings and the posterior likelihood please run::

  beat plot Laquila_resolution stage_posteriors --stage_number=-1 --mode=ffi --varnames=h_laplacian,h_SAR,like

.. image:: ../_static/example4/stage_-1_max.png
   :height: 350px
   :width: 350 px

For a comparison between data, synthetic displacements and residuals for the two InSAR tracks in a local coordinate system and a histogram of weighted variance reduction for a posterior model ensemble of 200 models please run::

  beat plot Laquila_resolution scene_fits --mode=ffi --nensemble=200

.. image:: ../_static/example4/scenes_-1_max_local_0.png

The plot should show something like this. Here the residuals are displayed with an individual color scale according to their minimum and maximum values.
