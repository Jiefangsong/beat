# Bayesian Earthquake Analysis Tool

Based on pyrocko, theano and pymc3

Documentation (under construction) can be found here:
https://hvasbath.github.io/beat/ .

This repository is very much work in progress!
Please dont expect anything to work smoothly!

It provides a python wrapper for the programs psgrn and pscmp.

## PSGRN and PSCMP (packaged as fomosto backend)

Code to calculate synthetic stress/strain/tilt/gravitational fields on a
layered viscoelastic halfspace.

PSGRN and PSCMP have been written by Rongjiang Wang.

Packaging has been done by Hannes Vasyura-Bathke.
